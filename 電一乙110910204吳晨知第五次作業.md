### a
程式碼：

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#define SIZE 10

int main(void) {
  enum string {
    X0,
    X1,
    X2 = 10,
    X3,
    X4,
    X5 = 20,
    X6,
    X7,
    X8 = 0,
    X9,
  };

  int n[] = {X0, X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, X6, X7, X8, X9};

  printf("%d\n", n[4] *= 3);
}
```

執行結果：

## 5.32
程式碼

```c
